Application for Tracking Workouts, made with Flutter.
[Available in Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kahluabear.workout_tracker)

### Development Status
I've added everything I wanted to add for my personal need which includes the functions and support for English and Korean Language. If requested and with some help on translations, I can add more languages, but unless I come up with more ideas on functionalities or find bugs while using it, the development will be on pause for now. 

## Basic Overview
The basic function is to keep track of workout sessions, and see how you progress in terms of weights/workouts

### Functionality

The three screenshots above show the basic functionality of the app.</br>
The Dashboard screen shows you your workouts so far in the month, and options to start a new session/routine. </br>
The second screen shows you how the "Add Session" Screen looks. Once done, the third screen shows you the overview of the workout session

</p>

As you add multiple sessions, you can see how you're max/avg weight of the specific workout changes over time </br>
Routines are just a group of workouts, where you can group and the "Add Session" screen will be pre-populated if you decide to choose "Start Routine"</br>
You can also see the previous workout sessions through the calendar view too

### Other Info

This App is honestly much better than my previous app money tracker in terms of function and quality in my opinion. I used Objectbox for Database instead of sfqlite. 

### Open Source!

While this app is open source, I use resources/libraries that are non-MIT. So first let me leave this here first. </br>

Also, I use the chart library from Syncfusion. Check their license [here](https://pub.dev/packages/syncfusion_flutter_charts/license) </br>
Basically, you can use the library if:

* You have less than five (5) developers in your organization
* You agree to be bound by Syncfusionâ€™s terms and conditions.
